title: Donate To Ukraine
---
<p>You all are likely to know about the Russia's war in Ukraine. Some of you
know that Ukraine is my homeland. What I never told is that since the first days
of the invasion we (my family) are trying to help our friends back there who
fight against the aggressor. By 'fight' I mean it, they're literally at the
front lines.  Unfortunately, our resources are not limitless. Therefore I would
like to ask for any donations you could make by using the QR code below.</p>

<p>I'm not asking this for myself. I never took a single penny for whatever I
was doing for the Raku language. Even more, I was avoiding applying for any
grants because it was always like "somebody would have better use for them".</p>

<p>But this time I'm asking because any help to Ukrainian militaries means saving
lives, both their and the people they protect.</p>
