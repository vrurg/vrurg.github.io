Just have noticed that normally I have 4 editors/IDEs running at the same time:

- [Comma](https://commaide.com/) for modules and an in-house project
- [Vim](https://vim.org) for scripts, blog and articles, and Perl
- [Atom](https://atom.io) for Rakudo core sources, where Vim Raku syntax support seems to be too slow for some large files
- (Visual Code Studio)[https://code.visualstudio.com] for TypeScript+Vue

Only Vim I could quit on occasion.

What is your state of affairs?
