A new article of _Advanced Raku For Beginners_ series is published now. With a
really surprising subject this time!
<!--more-->
It is about how we [define Raku](/arfb-publication/04-defining-raku/). Or, in
other words: how one knows that his code is Raku? Why a compiler has the right
to state that it is actually compiling Raku? And a few side concepts to provide
grounds for the main topic.

It may seem to be a bit late. But keeping in mind that the article refers back
to a few concepts from previous publications, it's probably right the time for
it!

Enjoy and don't forget to correct me whenever necessary!
