I have two major updates to announce.
<!--more-->

First, I have finally settled down on this site as my home for
development-related things.

Second, I have started a [series of articles](/arfb.html) aimed at
introducing Raku beginners to advanced details of the language. In a way, it was
an accidental thing started when I realized that for many newcomers starting
with Raku concepts of a container, role groups, and many other are very
confusing.

And here we go. This is the start but more to come, I hope.
