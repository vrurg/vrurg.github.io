<p>After almost half a year of work I finally publish my <a href="https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna">new project</a> <a href="https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=uk&tl=en&text=%D0%92%D1%96%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B0">Vikna</a>
<!--more-->
which is also the subject of <a href="https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/schedule/?mc_cid=cddbdea19a&mc_eid=746c87c8c4">my talk</a> at the upcoming <a href="https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/">Conference in the Cloud</a>.
</p>
<p>As the subject says, it is a clear pre-release and a proof of concept for the preview of those who might be interested. In the project I tried to get hold of all the best what Raku can offer in the field of asynchronous/threaded processing and OO. Whish you can as much fun trying it as I have in developing!
