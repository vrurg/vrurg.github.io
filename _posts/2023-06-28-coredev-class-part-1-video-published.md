The recording quality of the first Rakudo Core Development Class happened to be disastrous. Due to this I was very
hesitant to publish it without attempting to get it fixed first. To the full extreme of it, I thought I can just
re-record the screen part in higher quality and then apply the original audio. But last day I did some assessment of the
video and came to the conclusion that even if re-recording is ever possible technically, it'd be too costly time-wise.
Besides, the entire ending of the class was lost because I was carried away with the presentation and forgot to check
the status of recording which JITSI limits to 1 hour in one run.

And I gave up. With a few cut-outs and some titles added the video is now available. Enjoy and sorry for the glitches!
