After month and a half full of many events, I finally got time to complete one
more [article](/arfb-publication/06-proxy-container/) for the _Advanced Raku For
Beginners_ series.

Frankly, I'm not happy about it. It feels to me that my not the perfect English
is gotten even worse; not all topics and quirks are covered. But at least I'm
getting back in these waters. So, just let it be. I'm warming up. And hope to
advance into another subject soon.
